# apstra_to_healthbot
This script connects to an Apstra server, pulls information for all devices active on a blueprint, and onboards those devices into HealthBot. It then creates two Healthbot device groups per blueprint, one for spine devices and the other for leaf devices, and adds devices to the appropriate group.
